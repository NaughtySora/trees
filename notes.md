# Trees
**Connected acyclic graph with one node as a root**

## Key terms
- Height: number of edges on the longest path from root to a leaf.
- Depth: distance from root to a node.
- Leaf: node with no children.
- Degree: number of children a node has.
- Balance: how evenly spread the tree is.
- Subtree: node and its all descendants
- Children: closest descendants connected to node

# Binary tree
- up 2 children (left, right)

# Binary Search Trees (BST)

# Balanced Trees 
## Red-Black Tree
## AVL Tree
## Splay Tree

# Heaps

# B-Tree & Variants

# Tries

# Specialized Trees
- Segment Tree: range queries (min, max, sum over intervals).
- Fenwick Tree (BIT): efficient prefix sums.
- Interval Tree: store ranges (overlapping intervals).
- KD-Tree / QuadTree / Octree: spatial partitioning for geometry, games, AI.
- Merkle Tree: cryptography, blockchain (hashes in tree form).
- Treap: BST + heap (random priorities).
- Cartesian Tree: mix of heap and sequence.
- Van Emde Boas Tree: fast O(log log M) lookup for integers.

# General Purpose
- Balanced BSTs: general-purpose sets, maps.
- Heaps: priority queues.
- Tries: prefix-based search.
- B-Trees: databases, file systems.
- Segment Trees: range queries (competitive programming, analytics).
- Merkle Trees: cryptographic proofs.
